    Each sequence is written to its own ``.seq`` file.  A ``"next"``
    key is added to the ``[DEFINITIONS]`` section of every file except
    the last, pointing to the filename of the next file in the chain.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seqs : list of pp.Sequence
        Ordered list of pypulseq Sequence objects.
    path : str or Path
        Base file path.  For a single sequence the output is
        ``<path>.seq`` (the ``.seq`` suffix is added if missing).
        For multiple sequences the outputs are
        ``<path>_001.seq``, ``<path>_002.seq``, etc.

    Returns
    -------
    list of Path
        Paths of the written files, in order.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If *seqs* is empty.

    ----------
